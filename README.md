# Generic Tools for Frequent Operations
Generic Tools for Frequent Operations (GTFO) is yet another open-source C++ library that contains implementations of some general purpose thingies.
Requires at least limited C++14 support, as in MSVC 2015. Older versions won't do :(
GCC is supported starting from version 4.9.1.
